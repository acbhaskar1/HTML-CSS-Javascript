The <template> tag allows you to store invisible, dormant HTML in your page.
It doesn’t render.
It doesn’t affect layout.
It just sits there, waiting for you (or JS) to clone it like a [spellbook](https://goong.com/word/spellbook-meaning/).

This is the foundation of component-like logic in pure HTML.

👁️ Why this is dark magic?

The markup inside <template> does not render

No layout, no loading, no execution

Acts as an HTML component factory

Lets you generate UIs dynamically with clean structure

Helps you avoid innerHTML chaos 😅

Works beautifully with JS frameworks and plain vanilla JS
