🎯 Use the download attribute to trigger file downloads — no JS needed

You can make any link download a file instantly, without navigating to it, simply by adding download.
✔️ Clicking this link forces a download, even if the browser normally displays the file (like PNG, PDF, MP3, etc.)

🤔 Why it’s useful?

Create download buttons without JavaScript

Control file names clients receive

Great for offering assets, ebooks, PDFs, CSVs, photos

Works client-side only — great for static sites
